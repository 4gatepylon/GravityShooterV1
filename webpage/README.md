# (Original/Deprecated, not checked if up to date) High level view of the frontend
The user will go to a page where they can enter their name. Once they enter their name they can send a request
to the server to get a pvp opponent by clicking `submit`.

After submitting they will go to a loading screen. The screen will, in the background, poll with an HTTP request
for up to some timeout. If successful, we will recieve at some point an object telling us the pvp game to join
and we will join.

In the pvp game, we will always see the current state, which will be maintained using a websocket with the
`ingame_server.py` server script. Whenever we type on the keyboard we will be modifying the state and sending information with the websocket (each keystroke).

Conditionally, based on what the state is, we will display different things. That is to say, we will re-create the display
complete from scratch each time we get an update.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

WIP: a playground to basically get more experience (more than zero: like actually learn it at all) in Rust, combining games/n-body simulations, socket programming, and more.

As of August 17th, 2024 this is just a really bad space game (2 player, but local) that was my first usable (technically, if you can call it that) project in rust.
